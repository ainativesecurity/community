AI-native systems present unique security and compliance challenges due to their dynamic, data-driven nature and reliance on machine learning models. This document outlines the core goals and guiding principles to ensure these systems remain secure, trustworthy, and compliant with regulatory standards.

---

## **1. Data Security**

- **Goal:** Ensure that all data used in AI systems is stored, transmitted, and processed securely.
- **Key Practices:**
  - Encrypt data at rest and in transit.
  - Implement strict access controls and data masking.
  - Use secure data pipelines and audit logs for all data interactions.

---

## **2. Model Security**

- **Goal:** Protect AI models from theft, tampering, and adversarial attacks.
- **Key Practices:**
  - Sign and verify model artifacts.
  - Monitor for adversarial input and model drift.
  - Use sandboxing and runtime protections during inference.

---

## **3. Privacy Compliance**

- **Goal:** Ensure AI systems comply with global data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- **Key Practices:**
  - Enable data subject rights (access, deletion, correction).
  - Limit data retention and enforce purpose limitation.
  - Perform regular Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs).

---

## **4. Transparency and Explainability**

- **Goal:** Provide clear insight into AI system decisions and operations.
- **Key Practices:**
  - Document model training datasets, features, and decisions.
  - Enable explainability tools and dashboards for stakeholders.
  - Maintain traceability from input to output for audits.

---

## **5. Secure Deployment and Operations**

- **Goal:** Ensure secure and resilient deployment of AI systems in production.
- **Key Practices:**
  - Use containerization and automated security scanning.
  - Implement incident detection and response for AI-specific threats.
  - Apply least privilege and zero trust principles to AI services.

---

## **6. Compliance and Governance**

- **Goal:** Maintain continuous compliance with internal policies and external regulations.
- **Key Practices:**
  - Maintain auditable records of model lifecycle and decision-making.
  - Integrate compliance checks into CI/CD pipelines.
  - Assign governance roles for oversight of AI ethics and compliance.

---

## **7. Continuous Monitoring and Improvement**

- **Goal:** Regularly assess and improve the security posture of AI systems.
- **Key Practices:**
  - Conduct threat modeling and red teaming of AI components.
  - Monitor for anomalies, bias, and emerging vulnerabilities.
  - Update policies and models in response to new risks.
